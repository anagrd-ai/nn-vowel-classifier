If,1

History,0
The,0
idea,1
of,1
a,1
body,0
so,0
big,0
that,0
even,1
light,0
could,0
not,0
escape,1
was,0
briefly,0
proposed,0
by,0
English,1
astronomical,1
pioneer,0
and,1
clergyman,0
John,0
Michell,0
in,1
a,1
letter,0
published,0
in,1
November,0
1784,0
Michell,0
s,0
simplistic,0
calculations,0
assumed,1
such,0
a,1
body,0
might,0
have,0
the,0
same,0
density,0
as,1
the,0
Sun,0
and,1
concluded,0
that,0
one,1
would,0
form,0
when,0
a,1
star,0
s,0
diameter,0
exceeds,1
the,0
Sun,0
s,0
by,0
a,1
factor,0
of,1
500,0
and,1
its,1
surface,0
escape,1
velocity,0
exceeds,1
the,0
usual,1
speed,0
of,1
light,0
Michell,0
correctly,0
noted,0
that,0
such,0
supermassive,0
but,0
non,0
radiating,0
bodies,0
might,0
be,0
detectable,0
through,0
their,0
gravitational,0
effects,1
on,1
nearby,0
visible,0
bodies,0
8,0
12,0

Scholars,0
of,1
the,0
time,0
were,0
initially,1
excited,1
by,0
the,0
proposal,0
that,0
giant,0
but,0
invisible,1
dark,0
stars,0
might,0
be,0
hiding,0
in,1
plain,0
view,0
but,0
enthusiasm,1
dampened,0
when,0
the,0
wavelike,0
nature,0
of,1
light,0
became,0
apparent,1
in,1
the,0
early,1
nineteenth,0
century,0
14,0
as,1
if,1
light,0
were,0
a,1
wave,0
rather,0
than,0
a,1
particle,0
it,1
was,0
unclear,1
what,0
if,1
any,1
influence,1
gravity,0
would,0
have,0
on,1
escaping,1

In,1
1915,0
Albert,1
Einstein,1
developed,0
his,0
theory,0
of,1
general,0

having,0
earlier,1
shown,0
that,0
gravity,0
does,0
influence,1

Only,1
a,1
few,0
months,0
later,0
Karl,0
Schwarzschild,0
found,0
a,1
solution,0
to,0
the,0
Einstein,1
field,0
equations,1
that,0
describes,0
the,0
gravitational,0
field,0
of,1
a,1
point,0
mass,0
and,1
a,1
spherical,0
mass,0
16,0
17,0
A,1
few,0
months,0
after,1
Schwarzschild,0
Johannes,0
Droste,0
a,1
student,0
of,1
Hendrik,0
Lorentz,0
independently,1
gave,0
the,0
same,0
solution,0
for,0
the,0
point,0
mass,0
and,1
wrote,0
more,0
extensively,1
about,1
its,1
properties,0
18,0
19,0
This,0
solution,0
had,0
a,1
peculiar,0
behaviour,0
at,1
what,0
is,1
now,0
called,0
the,0
Schwarzschild,0
radius,0
where,0
it,1
became,0
singular,0
meaning,0
that,0
some,0
of,1
the,0
terms,0
in,1
the,0
Einstein,1
equations,1
became,0
infinite,1
The,0
nature,0
of,1
this,0
surface,0
was,0
not,0
quite,0
understood,1
at,1
the,0
time,0
,0
,0
In,1
1924,0
Arthur,1
Eddington,1
showed,0
that,0
the,0
singularity,0
disappeared,0
after,1
a,1
change,0
of,1
coordinates,0
In,1
1933,0
Georges,0
Lema√Ætre,0
realized,0
that,0
this,0
meant,0
the,0
singularity,0
at,1
the,0
Schwarzschild,0
radius,0
was,0
a,1
non,0
physical,0
coordinate,0
singularity,0
20,0
Arthur,1
Eddington,1
commented,0
on,1
the,0
possibility,0
of,1
a,1
star,0
with,0
mass,0
compressed,0
to,0
the,0
Schwarzschild,0
radius,0
in,1
a,1
1926,0
book,0
noting,0
that,0
Einstein,1
s,0
theory,0
allows,1
us,1
to,0
rule,0
out,1
overly,1
large,0
densities,0
for,0
visible,0
stars,0
like,0
Betelgeuse,0
because,0
a,1
star,0
of,1
250,0
million,0
km,0
radius,0
could,0
not,0
possibly,0
have,0
so,0
high,0
a,1
density,0
as,1
the,0
Sun,0
Firstly,0
the,0
force,0
of,1
gravitation,0
would,0
be,0
so,0
great,0
that,0
light,0
would,0
be,0
unable,1
to,0
escape,1
from,0
it,1
the,0
rays,0
falling,0
back,0
to,0
the,0
star,0
like,0
a,1
stone,0
to,0
the,0
earth,1
Secondly,0
the,0
red,0
shift,0
of,1
the,0
spectral,0
lines,0
would,0
be,0
so,0
great,0
that,0
the,0
spectrum,0
would,0
be,0
shifted,0
out,1
of,1
existence,1
Thirdly,0
the,0
mass,0
would,0
produce,0
so,0
much,0
curvature,0
of,1
the,0
spacetime,0
metric,0
that,0
space,0
would,0
close,0
up,1
around,1
the,0

e,1

In,1
1931,0
Subrahmanyan,0
Chandrasekhar,0
calculated,0
using,1
special,0
relativity,0
that,0
a,1
non,0
rotating,0
body,0
of,1
electron,1
degenerate,0
matter,0
above,1
a,1
certain,0
limiting,0
mass,0
now,0

the,0
Chandrasekhar,0
limit,0
at,1
1,0
4,0
M,0
has,0
no,0
stable,0
solutions,0
23,0
His,0
arguments,1
were,0
opposed,1
by,0
many,0
of,1
his,0
contemporaries,0
like,0
Eddington,1
and,1
Lev,0
Landau,0
who,0
argued,1
that,0
some,0
yet,0
unknown,1
mechanism,0
would,0
stop,0
the,0
collapse,0
24,0
They,0
were,0
partly,0
correct,0
a,1
white,0
dwarf,0
slightly,0
more,0
massive,0
than,0
the,0
Chandrasekhar,0
limit,0
will,0
collapse,0
into,1
a,1
neutron,0
star,0

which,0
is,1
itself,1
stable,0
,0
,0
In,1
1939,0
Robert,0

predicted,0
that,0
neutron,0
stars,0
above,1
another,1
limit,0
the,0
Tolman,0
Oppenheimer,1
Volkoff,0
limit,0
would,0
collapse,0
further,0
for,0
the,0
reasons,0
presented,0
by,0
Chandrasekhar,0
and,1
concluded,0
that,0
no,0
law,0
of,1
physics,0
was,0
likely,0
to,0
intervene,1

stop,0
at,1

was,0
marked,0
by,0

the,0

it,1
was,0
suspected,0
that,0
the,0

the,0

were,0
pathological,0
artifacts,1
from,0

imposed,1
and,1
that,0
the,0
singularities,0
would,0
not,0
appear,1
in,1

This,0

was,0
held,0
in,1
particular,0
by,0
Vladimir,0
Belinsky,0
Isaak,1
Khalatnikov,0

Lifshitz,0
who,0
tried,0
to,0
prove,0
that,0

However,0
in,1
the,0

The,0

of,1

is,1
a,1

the,0

the,0

of,1

very,0

Given,0
the,0
bizarre,0
character,0
of,1
black,0
holes,0
it,1
was,0
long,0
questioned,0
whether,0
such,0

could,0
actually,1
exist,1
in,1
nature,0
or,1
whether,0
they,0
were,0
merely,0
pathological,0
solutions,0
to,0
Einstein,1
s,0
equations,1
Einstein,1
himself,0
wrongly,0
thought,0
black,0
holes,0
would,0
not,0
form,0
because,0
he,0
held,0
that,0
the,0
angular,1
momentum,0
of,1
collapsing,0
particles,0
would,0
stabilize,0
their,0
motion,0
at,1
some,0

125,0
This,0
led,0
the,0
general,0
relativity,0
community,0
to,0
dismiss,0
all,1
results,0
to,0
the,0
contrary,0
for,0
many,0

However,0
a,1
minority,0
of,1

continued,0
to,0
contend,0
that,0
black,0

were,0
physical,0
objects,1
126,0
and,1
by,0
the,0
end,1
of,1
the,0
1960s,0
they,0
had,0
persuaded,0
the,0

in,1
the,0

that,0
there,0

no,0

that,0

that,0

Once,1

it,1
can,0
continue,0

absorbing,1

Any,1

continually,0
absorb,1

merge,0
with,0
other,1
objects,1
such,0
as,1

or,1
even,1

This,0
is,1
thought,0

in,1

By,0

145,0
If,1
Hawking,0

correct,0
then,0
black,0

to,0

they,0
lose,0

by,0
the,0

The,0

for,0
the,0

of,1
black,0

For,0

the,0
gravitational,0

suggests,0
that,0
the,0
separation,0
of,1
the,0
two,0

was,0
just,0
350,0

or,1
roughly,0
four,0
times,0
the,0
Schwarzschild,0

corresponding,0
to,0
the,0

The,0
objects,1
must,0
therefore,0
have,0
been,0
extremely,1

More,0
importantly,1
the,0
signal,0
observed,1
by,0

also,1
included,1
the,0

produced,0
as,1
the,0

settles,0
down,0
to,0
a,1

Arguably,1
the,0
ringdown,0
is,1
the,0
most,0
direct,0
way,0
of,1
observing,1
a,1

From,0

it,1

the,0

and,1
damping,0
time,0
of,1
the,0
dominant,0
mode,0
of,1
the,0

From,0
these,0
it,1
is,1
possible,0
to,0
infer,1
the,0
mass,0
and,1
angular,1
momentum,0
of,1
the,0
final,0
object,1
which,0
match,0
independent,1
predictions,0
from,0

of,1
the,0

174,0
The,0
frequency,0
and,1
decay,0
time,0
of,1
the,0
dominant,0
mode,0
are,1
determined,0
by,0
the,0
geometry,0
of,1
the,0
photon,0

Hence,0
observation,1
of,1
this,0
mode,0
confirms,0
the,0
presence,0
of,1
a,1

however,0
it,1
cannot,0
exclude,1
possible,0
exotic,1
alternatives,1

can,0
be,0

Since,0
the,0

Consequently,0
the,0
physics,0

the,0

alternative,1

This,0

now,0
known,0
as,1

of,1

is,1
remarkably,0
similar,0
to,0
the,0

which,0
states,0
that,0
the,0
total,0

of,1

can,0

As,1
with,0

at,1

it,1
was,0
assumed,1
that,0
black,0

If,1
this,0

the,0

would,0
be,0

resulting,0
in,1
a,1
decrease,0
in,1

Therefore,0
Bekenstein,0
proposed,0
that,0

The,0

with,0

by,0
Hawking,0
s,0
discovery,0
in,1
1974,0
that,0
quantum,0
field,0

predicts,0
that,0
a,1
black,0
hole,0
radiates,0
blackbody,0
radiation,0
at,1
a,1
constant,0

This,0
seemingly,0
causes,0
a,1
violation,0
of,1
the,0
second,0
law,0
of,1
black,0
hole,0
mechanics,0
since,0
the,0
radiation,0
will,0
carry,0
away,1
energy,1
from,0
the,0
black,0
hole,0
causing,0
it,1
to,0
shrink,0
The,0
radiation,0
also,1
carries,0
away,1
entropy,1
and,1
it,1
can,0
be,0
proven,0
under,1
general,0
assumptions,1
that,0
the,0
sum,0
of,1
the,0
entropy,1
of,1
the,0
matter,0
surrounding,0
a,1

and,1
one,1
quarter,0
of,1
the,0

of,1
the,0
horizon,0
as,1
measured,0
in,1
Planck,0
units,1
is,1
in,1
fact,0
always,1
increasing,1
This,0
allows,1
the,0
formulation,0
of,1
the,0
first,0
law,0
of,1
black,0

mechanics,0
as,1
an,1
analogue,1
of,1

One,1
puzzling,0
feature,0
is,1
that,0
the,0
entropy,1
of,1
a,1
black,0
hole,0
scales,0
with,0
its,1
area,1
rather,0
than,0
with,0
its,1
volume,0
since,0

is,1
normally,0
an,1
extensive,1
quantity,0
that,0
scales,0
linearly,0
with,0
the,0
volume,0
of,1
the,0
system,0
This,0
odd,1
property,0
led,0
Gerard,0

and,1
Leonard,0

to,0
propose,0
the,0

that,0
anything,1

this,0

a,1

a,1
principle,0
called,0

of,1

requires,0
that,0

the,0

cannot,0
be,0
fully,0
